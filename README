lslint is a tool to check the syntactic and semantic validity of Second Life
LSL scripts.



COMPILING:
make should be all that's required on POSIX systems, and should also work
under Cygwin on Windows if you fix the path to UPX.



LICENSE:
All code is public domain unless otherwise noted.

LSL scripts are from various sources and the property of their respective
owners.

.l and .y files are based on samples provided by Linden Lab.



WARNING:
lslint faithfully reproduced all the quirks of the LSL compiler circa ~2006,
like having constants as lexer tokens, events as part of the parser grammar,
and lots of right recursion. From a compiler perspective, it does everything
wrong, and is not recommended as a base for anything but a lint tool.

NOTE ABOUT CODE PAGE:
You may need to change the system locale to "English(US)" for successful compilation.
Use "chcp" command to make sure that the active code page is 437.

MODIFIED (by Makopoppo):
added nmake support (see NMAkefile for details).

dropped builtins.txt creator. if you look for new builtins.txt, see kwdb project.
